# xcode-github

GitHub has a great git hosting service.

Xcode has a great continuous integration service.

But Xcode can't monitor your GitHub repo for new pull requests and create new integration bots
for testing.

xcode-github is the Reeses(tm) that puts two great things, Xcode and GitHub, together so that you
can have great Xcode testing on new GitHub pull requests.

Finally!

## What's Included

* A macOS app that monitors your GitHub repos for PRs and creates new Xcode bots for them.
* A command line utility that has many of the same functions of the macOS app.
* A static library that has interfaces for GitHub and the Xcode CI system.
* An xctest test bundle for testing.
